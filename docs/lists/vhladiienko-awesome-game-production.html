  <p>A curated list of <strong>awesome</strong> resources, related to game production process - books, articles, tools, project management, methodologies - aimed to help game producers deliver their games.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_development">Video game development</a> (or production) is a process of developing a video game by a single person or a team of developers, not necessarily professionals or employed by someone to do so. This list is focused on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_producer">game producer’s</a> role - a person, who manages and orchestrates the game production process in multitude of ways. Hence the shortened list name.</p>

<p>This list does not cover specific disciplines like game design, quality assurance, programming. Refer to the <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome#gaming">Gaming section <img src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/sindresorhus/awesome" alt="GitHub Repo Stars" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"> <img src="https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/sindresorhus/awesome" alt="GitHub last commit" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></a> of the “master” awesome list for other gamedev stuff.</p>

<ul>
  <li>

Once completed, just adapt to your needs or just use some of the principles. It also includes numerous document templates and examples.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="-tools-and-templates">🔧 Tools and templates</h2>

<p>As a producer, you might need a few tools to help you deliver the damn thing. Some of these may not be useful to you directly, but I might have include one if I think you should at least know such a tool exists. This is to help you gain a few credits in your team.</p>

<h3 id="tools">Tools</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
<a href="https://machinations.io/">Machinations</a> - A tool, that helps prototyping game mechanics, economy flow and states either for production or for demo purposes.

  <li>
<a href="https://excalidraw.com/">Excalidraw</a> - A free and <a href="https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw">open source <img src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/excalidraw/excalidraw" alt="GitHub Repo Stars" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"> <img src="https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/excalidraw/excalidraw" alt="GitHub last commit" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></a> online drawing tool. Neither gamedev or project management related, but is so versatile, I find myself using it quite often.</li>
  <li>🎓 <a href="https://chat.openai.com/">ChatGPT</a> - Every time you are about to Google something, I would strongly advice first to ask ChatGPT your question. We, producers, might often need to reference or look up a term or a concept, which is where ChatGPT shines.</li>
