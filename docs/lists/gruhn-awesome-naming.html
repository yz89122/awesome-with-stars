<blockquote>
  <p>There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.</p>

  <p>― Phil Karlton</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Concepts in computer science are usually nothing tangible so it’s no surprise that naming things is hard.
Nevertheless, we <em>do</em> come up with clever, creative and funny names.
Some of them so established, we never pause and admire.</p>

<p>This is a curated list for when naming things is done right.</p>
