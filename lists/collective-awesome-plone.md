<!--lint ignore double-link-->
[Plone](https://plone.org) is a open source CMS written in Python with a focus on functionality, customizability and security out of the box.

There are over [3000 add-ons for Plone on pypi](https://pypi.org/search/?q=&o=&c=Framework+%3A%3A+Plone) and over 1500 repositories in the [collective](https://github.com/collective/). If you want to know if there is already a add-on for Plone that fits your needs, searching for it on GitHub or pypi can be hard. It's hard to understand which one could be a good solution or not.

This list is intended to fill that gap, and create a shared knowledge about common products and techniques.

For a filterable list of addons aggreating all Plone related packages from PyPi see https://pag.derico.tech.

This list only covers add-ons that work with the latest major versions of Plone (currently 5.2 and 6) and only those that support Python 3.

Plone 6 comes with a new default frontend called Volto, which is written in React and uses `plone.restapi` to communicate with Plone. Volto is very extendable in itself. Checkout the [awesome-volto list ![GitHub Repo Stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/collective/awesome-volto) ![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/collective/awesome-volto)](https://github.com/collective/awesome-volto) for add-ons to Volto.

## Finding more add-ons

It can be hard to find the right add-on for your requirements.
Here are some tips:

* Make a list of required features.
* Look in this list first.
* Search pypi: https://pypi.org/search/?c=Framework+%3A%3A+Plone
* Search the collective organization on github: https://github.com/collective
* Search the plone organization on github: https://github.com/plone
* Google for your requirements

Once you have a shortlist, test these add-ons. Here are the main issues you need to test before you install an add-on on a production site:

* Test all required features. Read but do not trust the documentation
* Check if the add-on runs on your required version
* Check if it is maintained
* Does it have i18n-support, i.e. is the user-interface translated to your language?
* Does it uninstall cleanly?
* Check for unwanted dependencies

Once you found an add-on you like, you can ask the community if you made a good choice or if you missed something:

* Message Board: https://community.plone.org

If you can't find something that fits your requirements 100% you can:

* Adapt your requirements to what is available.
* Invest the time & money to customize an existing add-ons to better fit your needs.
* Create a new add-on that does exactly what you need.
