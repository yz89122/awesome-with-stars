## Concurrency

Two concurrency libraries exist in OCaml: _Lwt_ and _Async_. They provide very similar functionality but make radically different decisions with regards to error handling and internal implementation details (see the links below for more details). [Real World OCaml](https://realworldocaml.org/) uses Async, but a version of the [code examples translated to Lwt ![GitHub Repo Stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/dkim/rwo-lwt) ![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/dkim/rwo-lwt)](https://github.com/dkim/rwo-lwt) is also available.

- **Libraries**:
  - [Lwt](http://ocsigen.org/lwt/) — A cooperative threads library for OCaml.
  - [Async](https://opensource.janestreet.com/async/) — A monadic concurrence library to go with the Core library.
