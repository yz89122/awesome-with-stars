## Why Copilot Agents

Customized instructions, prompts, agent skills, agent MCPs and custom agents help guide GitHub Copilot by providing contextual details about your repository such as the type of workflow your team follows, tools and other project specific details such as coding style, frameworks used or project specific rules.

**Tip**: Learn more about customizing GitHub Copilot in VS Code in the [VS Code documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/overview).

## Custom Agents

[Custom agents](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/custom-agents) let you set up different AI personas in VS Code for specific dev roles (like security reviewer, planner, or architect), each with its own instructions, tools, and behavior. You can also use handoffs to move between these specialized agents in a guided workflow (e.g., planning → implementation → review) with relevant context carried over.

The built-in available custom agents are:

- Agent
- Ask
- Edit
- Plan
- AIAgentExpert
- Configure Custom Agents (create your own)

## Agent Skills

Agent Skills are portable, [open standard](https://agentskills.io/home), version-controlled folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that agents can discover and load on demand to do tasks more accurately and efficiently. They let agents gain domain expertise, new capabilities, and repeatable workflows—while making those same skills reusable across different compatible agent products and teams.

## MCPs

MCPs (Model Context Protocol servers) give agents a standardized way to connect to external tools, APIs, data sources, and local capabilities. They extend what an agent can do beyond plain chat by exposing actions such as reading files, browsing the web, querying cloud platforms, or interacting with development tooling through a common protocol.

This section highlights useful MCP servers you can add to your Copilot setup to expand agent capabilities for research, development, automation, and cloud workflows.

**Tip**: Read more about setting up [VS Code Copilot](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/setup).

### Setup Instructions

1. Create instruction files using the latest naming conventions:
    1. Workspace instructions (place `*.instructions.md` files in `.github/instructions/` directory).
    2. Workspace prompts (place `*.prompt.md` files in `.github/prompts/` directory).
    3. Workspace custom agents (place `*.agent.md` files in `.github/agents` directory).
    4. Workspace custom skills (skills are stored in directories with a `SKILL.md` file that defines the skill's behavior).
    5. Workspace single instruction (place `copilot-instructions.md` in `.github` directory).

#### File Types

##### Instruction Files

`.instructions.md` - Contextual instructions that apply to specific files or file types.

##### Prompt Files

##### Custom Agent Files

`.agent.md` - Predefined AI personas behavior in VS Code for specific dev roles.

##### Custom Agent Skills

`SKILLS.md` - Portable, version-controlled folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that agents can discover and load on demand.

##### Formatting

## Contributing

All contributions are welcome! If you would like to share instruction files (`.instructions.md`), prompt files (`.prompt.md`), skills (`SKILL.md` in a skill folder) or custom agents (`.agent.md`), see the [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.
